# Nosock

## Inspiration
We wanted to do something fun and crazy! We've got this crazy idea about matching lonely socks with new pair and just realized how relevant this problem is: everyone has done their laundry and found a sock without a pair. We're here to fix it, we're here to change this lonely-sock world. Every lonely sock deserves a pair!

Inspired by [this](https://www.findyoursock.com/) Italian resource.

## What it does
If you ever wanted to get rid of some of your 'without a pair' and something better (other socks obviously), this app is for you!

## Features:
Upload information (name, size, location lost, type etc.) about your lonely socks
Browse socks near you with cool designs
Trade socks from your collection with other users

## How we built it
We used love, care and appreciation for our socks!
Also, using Flutter, Firebase and Meterial Design for designs.

## Challenges we ran into
None, it was pretty smooth. However, not enough time to finish it all:(

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
C'mon, isn't this the best app you ever heard of?

## What we learned
Socks are awesome and they deserve a second life! Let's make it happen together!

## What's next for Nosock
Our ambition is to become the biggest sock trading platform in the universe! We're almost there:)
